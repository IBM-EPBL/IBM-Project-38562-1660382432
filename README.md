# Car Resale value predictions


With difficult economic conditions, it is likely that sales of second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars and used cars will increase. In many developed countries, it is common to lease a car rather than buying it outright. After the lease period is over, the buyer has the possibility to buy the car at its residual value, i.e. its expected resale value. Thus, it is of commercial interest to sellers/financers to be able to predict the salvage value (residual value) of cars with accuracy.

In order to predict the resale value of the car, we proposed an intelligent, flexible, and effective system that is based on using regression algorithms. Considering the main factors which would affect the resale value of a vehicle a regression model is to be built that would give the nearest resale value of the vehicle. We will be using various regression algorithms and algorithm with the best accuracy will be taken as a solution, then it will be integrated to the web-based application where the user is notified with the status of his product.
# Problem Statement

Car buyers need a way to buy a car so that they approach a tool that determines the reasonable price.

# Project Overview

It is expected that sales of old cars and second-hand imported (reconditioned) cars will rise in tough economic times. Leasing a car rather than purchasing it entirely is common in many developed nations. After the lease term is up, the buyer will have the option of purchasing the vehicle for its residual value, or anticipated resale value. Therefore, being able to accurately anticipate the salvage value (residual value) of cars is in the best interest of sellers and financiers from a business standpoint.

We suggested an intelligent, adaptable, and efficient method that is based on applying regression algorithms to forecast the resale value of the vehicle. A regression model has to be created taking into account the primary variables that could impact the resale value of a vehicle.

# Project Objectives

1.To understand the problem to classify if it is a regression or a classification kind of problem.

2.To know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.

3.Applying different algorithms according to the dataset

4.To know how to evaluate the model.

5.To build web applications using the Flask framework.

# Project Flow

The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to enter the input features

Entered input features are analyzed by the model which is integrated

Once the model analyses the input, the prediction is showcased on the UI

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below Download the dataset.

Preprocess or clean the data.

Analyze the pre-processed data.

Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.

Save the model and its dependencies.

Build a Web application using Flask that integrates with the model built.
